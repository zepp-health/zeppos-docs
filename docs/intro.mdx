Zepp OS is a health management system designed for smart wearable devices, creating products and user experiences centered around "creating health value for users". At the same time, through a "lightweight" development framework on top of the operating system, it supports the development of watch faces and Mini Programs.

Here, following the documentation guide, you can quickly build Mini Programs and watch faces for devices running Zepp OS (such as Amazfit Active 2, Amazfit T-Rex 3, Amazfit Balance).
