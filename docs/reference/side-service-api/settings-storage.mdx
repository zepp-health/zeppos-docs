sidebar_label: Settings Storage API
---

The settingsStorage API can store data persistently in the Zepp App.

:::tip
Both the "Side Service" and the "Settings App" can access the data stored via `settingsStorage`.

The event system of `settingsStorage` can be used to communicate between the two ends.

For the communication method, please refer to the [Overall Architecture](../../guides/architecture/arc.mdx)
:::

## setItem

Storing key-value pairs.

### Type

```ts
(key: string, value: string) => void
```

## getItem

Get the stored value by key name.

### Type

```ts
(key: string) => result: string
```

### Code example

```js
settings.settingsStorage.setItem('key', 'Hello World')
const result = settings.settingsStorage.getItem('key')
```

## length: number

`settings.settingsStorage.length` returns the number of members in `settingsStorage`

## removeItem

Delete the value stored by the key name.

### Type

```ts
(key: string) => void
```

## clear

Delete all key-value pairs.

```ts
() => void
```

## toObject

Converts the content stored in `settingsStorage` to the form of an object.

### Type

```ts
() => Record<string, any>
```

### Code example

```js
const storageObj = settings.settingsStorage.toObject()

console.log(storageObj)
```

## addListener

:::caution
This API only needs to be used in the Side Service. The Settings App is "responsive" to data changes in `settingsStorage`, so there is no need to manually listen for data changes.
:::

Listens for changes to storage, with the agreed event name `change`, and can be used in the Side Service to listen for changes to data in `settingsStorage` by the Settings App.

### Code example

```js
settings.settingsStorage.addListener('change', async ({ key, newValue, oldValue }) => {
  if (key === 'token' && newValue) {
    // ...
    await reLogin()
  }
})
```
