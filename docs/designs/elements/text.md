# Text

## Design principles

**Meaningful**: The text should help the user make a choice, take an action, or understand the current state.

**Concise and comfortable**: The text should be simple, user-friendly, and relevant. Keep the user focused on the task and make the user feel good.

## Title

**Main titles**

- The main title is used to indicate or summarize the current page's content/function.

- It is recommended that the text of the main title in the page title bar follows the Title Case text rule, where the first letter of each major word is capitalized.

>① For round-screen devices, the text in the page title bar.
>
>② For square-screen devices, the text in the top status bar.

**Subtitles**

- When the main title cannot fully convey the content, add subtitles to supplement the information.

>① The subtitle should have a lower-level style than the main title to show the page hierarchy.

- The subtitle text in the page title bar should follow the sentence case text rule, meaning the first letter of the first word and all proper nouns are capitalized.

## Body text

The body text should show the full text without omission.

- Description text and introductions.

- Message content.

## Label text

- It is recommended that label text adheres to the "sentence case" text display rule, where the first letter of the first word and all proper nouns are capitalized. Care should be taken to avoid using all caps, as it can reduce readability speed.
