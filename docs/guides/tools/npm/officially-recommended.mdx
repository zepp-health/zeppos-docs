### [eazy-ble](https://github.com/zepp-health/easy-ble)

The Easy BLE library is an advanced BLE management tool for Zepp OS 3.0 watches that features an automated profile generator, a hybrid asynchronous and sequential queue for efficient handling of all operations including writing and reading, user-friendly string-based interactions, seamless auto-conversions of data and addresses, support for multiple data types, and simplified device management through MAC address-centric commands, all designed to enhance usability and streamline BLE communications.

### [eazy-draw](https://github.com/zepp-health/easy-draw)

This library was mainly created to extend the main widgets and add functionality to draw arbitrary lines on ZeppOS 2.0+, which can currently be achieved only with a polyline widget. But that widget has its limitations - high memory consumption, very limited viewport of about 150px, all lines have to be the same color. In contrast, the draw.line() can essentially draw multicolor lines in any direction of hypothetically any reasonable length. This makes for a great tool to base your GPS apps on devices that don't support Canvas.

### [eazy-storage](https://github.com/zepp-health/easy-storage)

The `EasyStorage` suite is a handy set of tools for `ZeppOS` applications. It includes `EasyStorage`, `EasyFlashStorage`, and `EasyTempStorage`. These tools give developers a wide range of options for managing data, from storing it in memory or in files, to using temporary storage. Each tool is designed to meet specific storage needs, making it easier and more efficient to handle application data. Next to these the suite has a `Storage` utility library that offers static methods for direct file operations. This includes reading and writing JSON objects, text, and binary data directly to and from the filesystem.

Alongside these storage solutions, we have `EasyTSDB` (time-series database). It’s a special part of the `EasyStorage` suite that’s all about managing time-series data. Just like `InfluxDB`, `EasyTSDB` is great at storing, retrieving, and analyzing time-series data. It uses a mix of `RAM` and filesystem storage to manage data effectively, and can handle data flushes to disk when `RAM` gets full. It’s perfect for applications that need to manage time-series data effectively, and it supports custom aggregation and querying over specific time ranges.
