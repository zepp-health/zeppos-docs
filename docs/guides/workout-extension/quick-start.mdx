# Quick Start

## Intro

This article will demonstrate how to create, develop, and test a Zepp OS Workout Extension application through a complete example.

Before we begin, let me introduce some relevant background：

:::info

- Workout Extension can only be used on devices with API_LEVEL 3.6 or above
- Workout Extension has the capabilities of most JS APIs, but there are some limitations. For details, please refer to [API restrictions](#api-restrictions)
- Workout Extension is an independent application with an independent appId. It needs to be created, submitted, and reviewed in the developer background before it can be launched on the app store
- Users can configure to run multiple Workout Extensions simultaneously

:::

## Basic process

### 1. Environmental preparation

The development process of "Workout Extension" is the same as that of Zepp OS Mini Program, and the required power builder is the same. Please refer to [Environment Preparation](../quick-start/environment.mdx) to complete the environment preparation.

### 2. Create project

In the process of creating a project, we directly use the `zeus create workout-sample` command of the [Zeus CLI](../tools/cli/index.md) tool to create a "Workout Extension" template project. Select the project type as `WORKOUT_EXTENSION`.

:::note
Please install the latest version of Zeus CLI using `npm i @zeppos/zeus-cli -g` before executing the command
:::

### 3. Run in simulator

This step-by-step process is consistent with the Zepp OS Mini Program. Refer to [Running Simulator](../quick-start/simulator-dev.mdx) to complete the installation and operation of the emulator.

Use the Terminal to enter the newly created "Workout Extension" directory, execute the `zeus dev` compile preview command, and we can see our workout extension application in the Simulator.

:::info
For the convenience of developers, the Workout Extension is displayed in the application list in the emulator, and the real machine needs to be added in the workout application (not displayed in the application list).
:::

### 4. Preview on a Watch

This development process is consistent with the Zepp OS Mini Program. Refer to [Preview on a Watch](../quick-start/preview.mdx) to complete the real machine preview.

## Relevant points

### "Workout Extension" related APIs

- [DataWidget Construction function](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/global/DataWidget.mdx)
- [SPORT_DATA widget](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/ui/widget/SPORT_DATA.mdx)
  - The SPORT_DATA widget is an API specially designed for "Workout Extension", with rich data item display types, which can achieve real-time display of sports data
- [getSportData](../../reference/device-app-api/newAPI/app-access/getSportData.mdx)
  - The `getSportData` interface can obtain real-time data of sports applications, and developers can process and record the data

### app.json

Please refer to [Mini Program Configuration](../../reference/app-json.mdx) for `app.json`.

The difference between Workout Extension is only in the configuration of the `module` field, where `data-widget` represents the Workout Extension configuration.

:::info
"Workout Extension" can only be used on devices with API_LEVEL `3.6` or above, and "minVersion" needs to be configured to `3.6`.
:::

The `widgets` field is an array with a maximum length of `1`. This means that in a Workout Extension application with the same appId, up to `1` Workout Extension plugin can exist simultaneously (multiple plugins may be supported later).

```json
"module": {
  "data-widget":{
    "widgets": [{
      "path": "pages/plugin1",
      "name": "plugin2",
      "icon": "icon2.png",
      "runtime": {
        "ability": [{
          "type": 1,
          "subType": [1, 2, 3]
        }]
      }
    }]
  },
}
```

| Properties | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type       | `number`        | Currently, only `1` can be filled in, representing the "Workout Extension" type                                                                                                                   |
| subType    | `Array<number>` | Supported sports types, an empty array `[]` represents support for all sports types, for the meanings of other sports types, please refer to the `subType` sports types at the end of the article |

The following pictures show the interface of the circular and square screen watches when they are turned on for workout. When `isPinned: 0` is set, you can see the floating battery and time bars at the top.

<img

/>

<img
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/workout-extension/isPinned_1.png')}
  width="35%"
  title="download_zepp"
/>

Under the circular screen of `480px`, the height of the floating bar is `68px`. Under the circular screen of `454 px`, the height of the floating bar is scaled proportionally `Math.ceil (454/480 * 68) = 64 px`.

On a square screen with a height of `390px`, the height of the floating bar is `60px`.

### Life Cycle

Workout Extension is basically the same as [Zepp OS Mini Program Lifecycle](../../guides/framework/device/life-cycle.md), with the addition of `onResume` and `onPause` lifecycles.

Before introducing the lifecycle, let's introduce a concept called "Pause" state. In this state, the context information of the application will be retained, but it cannot respond to the registered callback function, and the registered timer will pause.

After adding the "Workout Extension" plugin, trigger the `onCreate` lifecycle of `app.js`.

Then execute the `onInit` and `build` lifecycles of the "Workout Extension". Afterwards,`app.js` enters the "Pause" state until it enters the corresponding "Workout Extension".

"Workout Extension" has the feature of gaining focus, that is, when the page focuses on the "Workout Extension" plug-in, it will trigger the `onResume` life cycle, and when the "Workout Extension" loses focus, it will trigger the `onPause` life cycle.

:::info
When the "Workout Extension" plugin loses focus, it will enter the "Pause" state.
:::

### API restrictions

"Workout Extension" has some limitations in UI interaction.

- The drawing area is limited, and UI widgets can only be drawn within the boundaries of the device screen. For example, the drawing area size of "Workout Extension" on Amazfit T-Rex Ultra devices is consistent with the screen resolution of 454 x 454 px.
- Can only display single-page content, does not support long page scrolling.
- Sliding operation is not supported. Widgets such as `SCROLL_LIST`, `VIEW_CONTAINER`, `PAGE_INDICATOR`, `SCROLL_BAR` that support sliding or stacking layout are not supported on the page.
- Does not support gesture monitoring.
- Does not support button response.
- Support `CLICK` event. Widgets within the page support click events.

### Workout Extension i18n configuration

```json
"i18n": {
  "ar-EG": {
    "data-widget": {
      "widgets": [
        {
          "name": "Running Pace Master"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "ca-ES": {
    "data-widget": {
      "widgets": [
        {
          "name": "Running Pace Master"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
}
```
