### ✅ **Watch Face Design Concept: "Cyclo-X1"**

#### 🎯 **Theme**: Sporty & Functional

#### 🕐 **Style**: Analog-Digital Hybrid (Modern Speedometer Look)

### 🔧 **Key Features to Include**

#### 1. **Central Analog Clock**

* **Hour and Minute hands** with bold, neon color (e.g., red/green)
* **Second hand** in a contrasting color (e.g., white)

#### 2. **Digital Speedometer Display**

* Large **digital speed display** in the top-middle or bottom-center (in km/h or mph)
* Speed pulled from GPS (if supported by paired phone or watch sensors)
* Range: 0–99+ km/h

#### 3. **Speed Ring (Circular Arc Meter)**

* A half or full **ring arc around the screen**, indicating speed visually like a tachometer
* Colored segments:

  * Green (0–20 km/h)
  * Yellow (20–40 km/h)
  * Red (40+ km/h)

#### 4. **Odometer Section**

* Small area below speed display showing **total ride distance** (e.g., "12.3 km")

#### 5. **Time & Date**

* Digital **time (HH\:MM)** in upper right
* **Date (e.g., Tue, 16 Jul)** in upper left

#### 6. **Battery Level**

### 📱 Compatibility Notes for Mibro X1:

* The Mibro X1 supports custom watch faces via the **Mibro Fit app**.
* Speedometer data may need to be fetched via the **phone’s GPS** using a third-party fitness or biking app if the watch doesn’t have GPS.

Would you like me to generate a **graphical version (image)** of this watch face? I can design one visually so you can visualize or even use it as a reference for customization.
