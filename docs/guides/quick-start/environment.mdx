In this section, we will complete the following environment preparations.

- Node.js (v >= 16.0)
- Zeus CLI

## Install Node.js

Visit the [Node.js Official website - Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)ã€‚

It is recommended to install through the `nvm` package manager. The following installation instructions are excerpted from the `Node.js` official website.

```sh
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 20

# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v20.15.0`

# verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.7.0`
```

:::info

- In Windows, we recommend using the built-in `PowerShell` to execute commands as an administrator
- It is recommended to use the built-in `Terminal` in MacOS and Linux to execute commands

:::

Step one, execute the first command in the official website installation guide, install nvm (Node Version Manager), copy the command to the end point, and press "Enter" on the keyboard.

```js
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

Step 2, execute the second command in the official website installation guide to install Node.js. It is recommended to directly install the `lts` version.

Execute the following two commands in sequence at the **Windows** PowerShell

```sh
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

Execute the following two commands in sequence at the **MacOS** or **Linux** Terminal

```sh
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Step three, check if Node.js has been installed successfully. Execute the following command at the end point. If the end point displays a version number such as `v20.15.0`, it indicates a successful installation.

```sh
node -v
```

## Install Zeus CLI

[Zeus CLI](../tools/cli/index.md) is a Zepp OS command-line toolset that we use to create, preview compiles, and build Zepp OS Mini Programs or Watchface projects.

The first step is to execute the installation command at the terminal.

```sh
npm i @zeppos/zeus-cli -g
```

The second step is to check whether the Zeus CLI is installed successfully. Execute the following command at the terminal. If the end point displays a version number such as `1.5.20`, it means that the installation is successful.

```sh
zeus -v
```
