## Install and run the Zepp OS Simulator

According to the system version, download the corresponding Simulator installation package, follow the prompts to install, [Simulator download](../tools/simulator/download.md).

For more information about the Simulator, please refer to [Guide to using the simulator](../../guides/tools/simulator/index.md).

## Simulator Preview

Let's navigate to the `hello-world` directory using the terminal. Once there, run the [`zeus dev` compile preview command](../../guides/tools/cli/index.md#zeus-preview-compilation-preview-real-machine) compile preview command. This instructs the Zeus CLI to compile the project code and initiate a preview via the simulator.

```sh
zeus dev
```

Wait for the Mini Program to finish installing and preview our `hello-world` Mini Program in the Amazfit Balance Device Simulator.
