![Architecture Diagram](/img/docs/guides/architecture/architecture.jpg)

The complete Mini Program includes Device App, Settings App and Side Service.

- Device App
  - The Device App runs on a watch device
  - The operating system of the watch device is Zepp OS
  - The Device App can call the widget API to draw UI and call a series of sensors to obtain data
- Settings App(optional)
  - Settings App runs in the Zepp App on mobile devices
  - Settings App draws UI by calling render function
- Side Service(optional)
  - Side Service runs in the Zepp App on mobile devices
  - Side Service can communicate with external servers through Fetch API

## Communication Relationships

### BLE

BLE is used for communication between Device App and Side Service. The underlying BLE API is not user-friendly, so we provide the [ZML](https://github.com/zepp-health/zml) tool library, which has a more complete implementation of the communication process and exposes the easy-to-use API.

- Use `this.request` method to send messages in Device App and `onRequest` to receive messages in Side Service
- Use `this.call` method to send messages in Side Service and `onCall` to receive messages in Device App

### Settings Storage

Communication between Settings App and Side Service relies on Settings Storage API.

:::info
To facilitate the display of data relationships, two Settings Storage are drawn in the figure, which are actually the same thing.
:::

[Settings Storage](../../reference/side-service-api/settings-storage.mdx) use `setItem` to set the data and use `getItem` to get the value.

- Settings App -> Side Service (the red line)
  - Use `addListener` API in Side Service to register callback function to listen to data changes in Settings Storage
  - Use `setItem` to change data in the Settings App and trigger the registered callback function
  - When use `setItem` to set data in the Side Service, automatically call Settings App `build` lifecycle, redraw UI.
- Side Service -> Settings App (the blue line)
  - Use setItem to change data in the Side Service
  - Settings Storage detects that data has changed, automatically triggers the re-rendering of the Settings App, and executes the `build` lifecycle

### Side Service communicates with third-party Service using Fetch API

Usage reference [Fetch API](../../reference/side-service-api/fetch.mdx)

## More Info

:::caution
Direct communication between "Device App" and "Settings App" is not possible and requires a "Side Service".
