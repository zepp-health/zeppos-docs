## FAQ

### Q1: What are the requirements for the colors of an app icon?

App icons should avoid using pure black or dark backgrounds. Since the system default background is black, a dark background will cause the icon to blend with the system background, thereby reducing the recognizability of the icon. We recommend choosing the app's brand color or other colors that can reflect the app's characteristics.

> Pure black or near-black backgrounds will merge with the system's default black background, making it indistinguishable, as shown in the image above. This will cause your app icon to lose its circular background contour, reducing the recognizability of the icon.

> Correct design example

The background image should not contain transparent areas, which affect the visual impact and recognizability of the icon.

Icons should not have transparency, ensuring that the background color does not show through the icon, to maintain the clarity and distinguishability of the icon.

### Q2: Can the shape of the app icon be freely designed?

The overall shape of the app icon should be a perfect circle, to avoid creating a visually irregular look that disrupts the uniformity of the system.

> ① Do not use non-circular background images

The main graphic of an app list icon should not exceed the background image area.This helps maintain the overall integrity and visual uniformity of the icon.
