# How to log in to the Simulator with a third-party authorized login account?

Simulator does not support third-party authorized login. You can only log in with your email and password.

After logging in with third-party authorization in the Zepp App, bind your email address, log out of the Zepp App account after successful binding, click Forgot Password on the login interface, and retrieve it through email or mobile verification code to set the password.

Go back to the login page of Simulator, and use your email and password to successfully log in to your Zepp account.
