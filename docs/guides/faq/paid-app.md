# Submitting Paid Mini Programs or Watchfaces

Zepp OS has strict restrictions on the submission of paid Mini Programs or Watchfaces.

## Official Paid Channel for Zepp Store

Only certified corporate developers in Mainland China can submit paid Mini Programs or Watchfaces in the Zepp Store, and their works can be listed in Zepp Stores outside of Mainland China.

:::note
To become a certified corporate developer, please contact Zepp OS staff in [the developer community](../community.md).
:::

Users outside of Mainland China can download the works after completing the payment through Apple Store or Google Play.

Payments can be divided into three tiers:

| --- | USD | EUR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.99 Tier | $1.99 | €1.99 |
| 2.99 Tier | $2.99 | €2.99 |
| 3.99 Tier | $3.99 | €3.99 |

Zepp Health takes a 15% share of the developer's revenue, and after deducting the 30% commission that Apple or Google takes for in-app purchases, the developer can receive a revenue of 100% - 15% - 30% = 55%.

## In-App Purchases for Mini Programs

Zepp OS allows developers to use reasonable in-app purchase solutions for Mini Programs, such as [Kiezelpay](https://kiezelpay.com/) or other QR code reward schemes, and the payment method must be explained at the time of app submission.

## Other Common Questions

- How can developers outside of Mainland China submit paid Watchfaces?
  - This method is currently not supported by the official channel.
- Why are paid Mini Programs or Watchfaces not available in Mainland China?
  - The mobile app market in Mainland China is quite complex, and there are many issues with payment channels, hence the temporary non-availability of paid Mini Programs or Watchfaces.
