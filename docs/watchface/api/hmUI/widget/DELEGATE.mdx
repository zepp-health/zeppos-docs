## Watchface Lifecycle

The DELEGATE widget can be used to monitor the Watchface lifecycle. It is a virtual widget that does not render any content and only handles lifecycle events.

| Callback Name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| resume_call  | Triggered when Watchface first launches or returns from other screens |
| pause_call   | Triggered when sliding to secondary widget, notifications, shortcut cards, entering app list, or launching other apps from Watchface |

## Code Example

```js
const widgetDelegate = hmUI.createWidget(hmUI.widget.WIDGET_DELEGATE, {
  resume_call: function () {
    console.log('Watchface resume')
  },
  pause_call: function () {
    console.log('Watchface pause')
  }
})
```
