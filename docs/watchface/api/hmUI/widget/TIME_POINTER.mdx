## Code example

```js
let timePointer = hmUI.createWidget(hmUI.widget.TIME_POINTER, {
  hour_centerX: 240, // Center of pointer rotation corresponds to centerX.
  hour_centerY: 240, // Center of pointer rotation corresponds to centerY.
  hour_posX: 19, // The pointer's own center of rotation, corresponds to the x in position.
  hour_posY: 100, // Pointer's own center of rotation, corresponds to y in position.
  hour_path: 'pointer.png', // Path of the pointer.
  hour_cover_path: 'cover.png', // Pointer circle image.
  hour_cover_y: 0,
  hour_cover_x: 0
  // Minute and seconds as same as above, just replace hour with minute/second.
})
```

:::warning

- xx_cover is an optional field
- It is recommended to configure at most one image for hour, minute and second hands. Configuring multiple images may affect the Watchface performance
