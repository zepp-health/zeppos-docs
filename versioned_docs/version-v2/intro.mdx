Zepp OS is a health management system for smart watches and wearable devices that aims to create products and user experiences based on the concept of "creating health value for users". At the same time, on the upper layer of the operating system, through its "lightweight" development framework, Zepp OS supports the development of Mini Program and Watchface.
