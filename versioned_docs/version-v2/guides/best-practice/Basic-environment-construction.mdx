## Introduction

The Zepp OS development environment is very simple to set up, requiring only a Node.js environment and a code editor.

This article will guide developers through a quick build of the Zepp OS development environment, including the installation of Node.js and the installation of the code editor.

## Installing Node.js

Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. npm is the package manager for Node.js modules.

nvm is a version management tool for Node.js. It allows you to install and switch between different versions of Node.js. We recommend using nvm to download and install Node.js.

### Install nvm

The installation of nvm needs to be environment specific

#### For Windows, please see

> Official documentation: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

It is recommended to download the `nvm-setup.exe` installation package from [nvm-windows Releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) to install.

### For MacOS and Linux, please see

> Official documentation: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

1.Open a terminal and run either of the following two lines of command.

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh

// or

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh
```

2.Configure environment variables.

- Execute the command `vim ~/.bashrc` to access the file.

- Press `i` to enter input mode (also known as edit mode) and begin editing the text by moving the cursor to the last line and adding the following fields.

```txt
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

- Press `esc` to save and then `:wq` to exit.

3.Verify that the installation is successful.

Execute `nvm -v`, if the version number is output, the installation is successful.

### Installing and switching Node.js versions using nvm

Open the terminal command line (Windows recommended PowerShell) and follow the steps below to execute the command.

1.Type `nvm insatll --lts` to install the latest LTS version of Node.js.

2.Use `nvm ls` to view the installed version of Node.js

3.Use the `nvm use <version>` command to switch to any version.

4.Run `node -v` at the command line, if the version number is output, then Node.js is successfully installed.

## Code Editor

There are many code editors to choose from, and we recommend that developers use the Visual Studio Code editor.

### Introduction to VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code for short) is a free, cross-platform source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports syntax highlighting, automatic code completion (also known as IntelliSense), code refactoring, and has built-in command line tools and a Git version control system. VS Code is recommended for software development.

### Download VS Code

It is recommended to download the corresponding installation package from the official VS Code website according to your operating system and install it.
