## Zepp OS Technical Forum

https://github.com/orgs/zepp-health/discussions

![github_forum](/img/docs/guides/community/github_forum.jpg)

Technical issues suitable for public discussion are recommended to be posted in the Zepp OS Technical Forum, which is better associated with the Github code repository, and the discussions can be tagged for easy searching.

Official staff from Zepp Health and developers from the community will be available to answer a range of technical questions, and since the community is open to Zepp OS developers worldwide, English is recommended for discussions.
