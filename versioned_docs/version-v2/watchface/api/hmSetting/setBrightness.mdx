title: hmSetting.setBrightness(brightness)
sidebar_label: setBrightness
---

Sets the screen brightness of the current device, in the range [0, 100].

If auto-brightness is currently turned on and the brightness is automatically adjusted by the light sensor, the `setBrightness` function will have no real effect. You need to turn off auto-brightness first and then set the screen brightness.

If you exit the page, you need to consider whether you need to set the brightness back to the original one.

## Type

```ts
(brightness: number) => result
```

## Parameters

### brightness

|                           Description                    | Required |   Type   | Default |

### result

|                     Description             |   Type   |
