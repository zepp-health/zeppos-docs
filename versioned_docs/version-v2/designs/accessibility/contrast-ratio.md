# Contrast ratio

- Follow the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum) principles.

    According to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum) principles (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (contrast ratio between text and background behind the text), except for the following:

    **Large text:** Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

    **Incidental:** Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.

- Use the contrast checker to check the text contrast.
